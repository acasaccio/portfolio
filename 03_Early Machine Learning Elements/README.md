# Early Machine Learning Projects

## Overview

Welcome to the Early Machine Learning Projects section of my portfolio. This folder contains four foundational machine learning projects that demonstrate my ability to apply various machine learning techniques to real-world data. Each project includes detailed narratives, code, and interpretations of the results.

## Contents

### Clustering Healthcare Data

This project involves preparing a healthcare dataset, using silhouette scores, the elbow method, k-means clustering, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify subgroups within the data. The project concludes with a detailed interpretation of the results and potential next steps for clinical applications.

#### Documents:

- **Narrative and Code**: A combined document of narrative and code, outlining the data preparation process, clustering methods used, and final interpretations.
- **Interpretation**: The PCA and clustering analysis identified two main subgroups within the ALS dataset, suggesting meaningful heterogeneity within the patient population.

### Examination of a Case Study - A Critical Approach

This white paper critically analyzes a selected article, "A Machine Learning Framework to Predict the Risk of Opioid Use Disorder." The paper discusses the problem statement, data acquisition, methods and results, modeling techniques, and conclusions, providing a comprehensive overview of the study's findings and implications.

#### Documents:

- **Critical Analysis**: A detailed white paper presenting a critical approach to evaluating the machine learning framework proposed in the selected article.

### Time Series Modeling

This project focuses on time series analysis, including data cleaning, identifying and managing outliers, linear regression, Holt's linear trend, SARIMA model, and model evaluation. The conclusion discusses the effectiveness of Holt's Linear Trend model based on evaluation diagnostics.

#### Documents:

- **Narrative and Code**: A detailed document outlining the data preparation, modeling techniques, and evaluation of time series models.
- **Conclusion**: Holtâ€™s Linear Trend model was determined to be the best fit for the data based on RMSE, MAE, and MAPE metrics.

### Movie Recommender System

In this project, I developed a movie recommender system using the small MovieLens dataset and Python. The system uses collaborative filtering to provide movie recommendations based on user preferences, demonstrating practical applications of data cleaning, matrix manipulation, and similarity calculations.

#### Documents:

- **Narrative and Code**: A document detailing the development of the movie recommender system, including data processing, model development, and the recommendation function.
- **Summary**: A brief overview of the project's approach and outcomes.
