# Data Visualization Projects

## Overview

Welcome to the Data Visualization Projects section of my portfolio. This folder contains various projects demonstrating my ability to create a wide range of visualizations using R, Python, and Power BI. Each document includes sample data and the corresponding code to generate the specified types of graphs. Additionally, there is a sample blog post for an invented healthcare system that showcases the application of these visualizations in a real-world context.

## Contents

### Line and Step Graphs

This document includes examples of line and step graphs, created using sample data. The graphs are generated using R, Python, and Power BI, showcasing different approaches and tools for visualizing trends over time.

### Tree Map and Area Graphs

This document demonstrates the use of tree maps and area graphs to represent hierarchical data and cumulative totals. The examples are created using sample data and generated with R, Python, and Power BI.

### Scatter Plots, Bubble Charts, and Density Maps

This document contains scatter plots, bubble charts, and density maps, illustrating the relationships between variables and the distribution of data points. The visualizations are produced using R, Python, and Power BI with sample datasets.

### Heat Map, Spatial Chart, and Lollipop Chart

This document showcases heat maps, spatial charts, and lollipop charts, providing insights into data patterns, geographical distributions, and categorical comparisons. The visualizations are created with sample data using R, Python, and Power BI.

### Histogram, Box Charts, Bullet Charts, and Rose Graphs

This document includes histograms, box charts, bullet charts, and rose graphs, highlighting the distribution of data, statistical summaries, performance metrics, and cyclical patterns. The graphs are generated using sample data with R, Python, and Power BI.

### Sample Blog Post for an Invented Healthcare System

This document features a sample blog post for an invented healthcare system, including a narrative description and the corresponding visualizations. The blog post demonstrates how to effectively communicate data insights to a broader audience using various types of charts and graphs.
