		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> The purpose of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)
is to obtain information about the amount and distribution of illness,
its effects in terms of disability and chronic impairments, and the
kinds of health services people receive. Provided with this Hypertension Supplement are variables from the 1974 core Person File (see HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY, 1974 [ICPSR 8339]) including sex, age, race, marital status, veteran
status, education, income, industry and occupation codes, and limits on
activity. The variables unique to the Hypertension Supplement File (Part 1) include items on blood pressure history, weight control issues, doctor visits, salt use, medicines prescribed and/or used, side effects of medicine, number of
bed days in the last year, whether the respondent's condition was
covered by insurance, the last time the respondent had an
electrocardiogram, chest x-ray, or diabetes check, and smoking, stroke,
and cardiac histories.</span></p>

								<p><span><strong>Restrictions:</strong> In preparing the data tape(s) for this collection, the
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) has removed direct
identifiers and characteristics that might lead to identification of
data subjects. As an additional precaution, NCHS requires, under
section 308(d) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 242m), that
data collected by NCHS not be used for any purpose other than for
statistical analysis and reporting. NCHS further requires that analysts
not use the data to learn the identity of any persons or establishments
and that the director of NCHS be notified if any identities are
inadvertently discovered. ICPSR member institutions and other users
ordering data from ICPSR are expected to adhere to these restrictions.</span></p>
