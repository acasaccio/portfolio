## Fiber Optic Cable Calculator

This program calculates the cost of installing fiber optic cable based on user input. The user is prompted to enter their company name and the number of feet of cable to be installed. The program then calculates and displays the cost per square foot and the total cost.

- **Screenshot of Code**: Demonstrates the programming logic and structure.
- **Screenshot of Output**: Shows the program in action with a sample input and output.

**Purpose**: This project was a simple yet effective exercise in basic programming concepts, including input handling, mathematical operations, and output formatting.

## Investigating Hypertension Disparities in Black America

This project explores hypertension disparities in Black America, focusing on data from the NHIS Survey conducted in 1974 and 2019. The analysis highlights trends, changes, and ongoing issues related to hypertension in this population over time.

**Objective**: To analyze hypertension-related questions from the NHIS Survey Data, compare the findings from 1974 and 2019, and provide insights into the disparities in hypertension prevalence and management within the Black American community.

**Key Findings**: The study provides a detailed look at how hypertension has been addressed, identifying gaps and areas for improvement in healthcare access and education.
